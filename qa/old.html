<div class="section" id="new-look-and-feel">
<h2>New Look and Feel<a class="headerlink" href="#new-look-and-feel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Brightspot now has a flatter, more material design. The UI presents more options without disruption or requiring the user to switch to new screens. It also uses tabs more extensively to ease spacing.</p>

<div class="section" id="user-dashboard-controls">
<h3>User Dashboard Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#user-dashboard-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new user dashboard system allows each user to customize his or her own dashboard layout, including the Common Content widget’s settings. Defaults can now be set by site and role.</p>
<p>Dashboard widget positions can be stored for multiple dashboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selections">
<h3>Selections<a class="headerlink" href="#selections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Brightspot now allows multiple pieces of content of the same type to be selected in search results and quickly manipulated: bulk-edited, bulk-deleted, etc.</p>
<p>Developers can now customize Brightspot so that multiple selected pieces of content even be selected and formed into content types designed to hold them. For example, images can be collected into galleries, songs into play lists, and so on, provided the collected content pieces fit into the fields of the collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search-results-carousel">
<h3>Search Results Carousel<a class="headerlink" href="#search-results-carousel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new carousel has been implemented to show the results of a search. Each result is represented by a slide in the carousel. By shifting slides, you can open a result in the content editor without losing the list of search results.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/search-results-carousel.png" src="../../_images/search-results-carousel.png" />
<p>Developers can allow the preview image used in the carousel to be customizable.</p>
<p>Developers can customize search results suggestions.</p>

<div class="section" id="improved-features">
<h2>Improved Features<a class="headerlink" href="#improved-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="search-panel">
<h3>Search Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#search-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The search panel has a new look and feel. Its design is more material, and it runs more quickly.</p>
<p>The search panel can be used to bulk restore items.</p>
<p>The search results action section now shows previews of selected search results, indicating the items that will be acted on when a search results action is selected.</p>
<p>Searches can now be saved for easy repeating and limited to a set number of results.</p>
<p>Search results have been improved. They can now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>be saved for easy repeating.</li>
<li>be multi-selected and created into a work stream.</li>
<li>be exported in CSV format.</li>
<li>be used to create drafts of new content, so that the existing content is used as a starting point. For example, three images could be selected to create an image gallery, which would then include those three images.</li>
<li>be viewed in an infinite scroll pagination, if they are previewable and viewed in grid mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Show Missing option has been removed because it confused some users and was redundant. Content with a particular field left empty can be found using the advanced query feature.</p>
<p>Java interfaces and abstract classes can be searched as content types, so that any content types that implement/extend the particular interface or abstract class will be found by search for the interface or abstract class. For example, if movie review articles and book review articles both implement the review interface, a search for reviews will find both movie reviews and book reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-and-enhancements">

<p>Sub-content can now be visually rearranged in a piece of content when a new annotation is used and the underlying classes are properly configured.</p>
<p>Permalinks can now be external URLs. Assigning an external URL to a piece of content makes it function as a URL redirect to the URL.</p>
